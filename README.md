# Agent-based-Stream-Model

This program is coded in JAVA 8 or later with parallel computation design. 
An agent (named as "parcel" in the code) represents a small amount of water and solute (NO3-N). This small amount is user-defined. 
Generally, the smaller the amount of water and solute a parcel represents, the higher accuracy of the model and higher computational resource the program demands.

(the code of this program/model is being tested and will be available soon).
